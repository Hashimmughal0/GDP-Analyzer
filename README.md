# GDP Analytics Dashboard

**SDA Project**  
Created by: **24L-0775** and **24L-0744**

## What's This Project About?

So basically, we built a data analysis tool that takes World Bank GDP data and lets you filter it by region/year, compute stats like average or sum, and then visualize it with graphs. It's config-driven, meaning you don't hardcode anything — all the filtering and operations are controlled through a JSON config file.

## How It's Organized

The project is structured with clear separation of concerns (that's the Single Responsibility Principle they keep talking about):

```
SDA_Project/
├── main.py                    # Entry point, runs the whole pipeline
├── config/
│   └── config.json           # Where you define what region, year, operation to use
├── data/
│   └── GDP_Data.csv          # The actual World Bank data
└── utilities/
    ├── __pycache__/
    ├── config_loader.py      # Reads and validates config.json
    ├── data_loader.py        # Loads the CSV file
    ├── data_cleaner.py       # Handles the messy data transformation
    ├── data_processor.py      # Filters data and does the math
    ├── dashboard.py          # Prints results and calls the plotting
    └── visualizer.py         # Makes the graphs
```

Each module does one thing:
- **config_loader**: reads JSON, validates required fields
- **data_loader**: just opens the CSV, nothing fancy
- **data_cleaner**: transforms wide CSV format → long format (one row per year)
- **data_processor**: filters by region/year, calculates average/sum
- **dashboard**: displays results and kicks off visualization
- **visualizer**: creates bar charts, pie charts, histograms, etc.

## How to Use It

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

### 2. Set Up Your Config

Edit `SDA_Project/config/config.json`:

```json
{
  "region": "South Asia",
  "year": 2020,
  "operation": "average",
  "output": "dashboard"
}
```

Fields:
- `region`: Filter by region (e.g., "South Asia", "Asia", "Africa"). Note: if the exact region isn't found, it falls back to year-only filtering.
- `year`: Which year you want to analyze (must be an integer)
- `operation`: Either `"average"` (mean GDP) or `"sum"` (total GDP)
- `output`: Currently just set this to `"dashboard"` (that's the main mode)
- `top_n` (optional): Limit the number of countries shown in the bar chart. Default is 12.

### 3. Run It

```bash
python SDA_Project/main.py
```

You'll see:
1. A text output with the config values and the computed result (formatted as Trillion/Billion/Million USD)
2. Four charts pop up:
   - **Bar chart**: Top N countries by GDP
   - **Pie chart**: GDP distribution (combines small slices into "Other")
   - **Histogram**: Distribution of GDP values
   - **Scatter plot**: GDP values by index

## Key Features

### Config-Driven Everything
No hardcoded region, year, or operation. It's all in the JSON file. If you want to run a different analysis, just edit the config and rerun — no code changes needed.

### Flexible Data Handling
The CSV is in "wide format" (days as columns), so we reshape it to "long format" (one row per year). Also handles missing `Region` by falling back to `Continent` field.

### Human-Readable Numbers
Instead of showing `1e12` or whatever, graphs display values in Billion, Million, Trillion USD. Makes the dashboard actually useful.

### Smart Filtering
- Region matching is case-insensitive and does substring matching (so "asia" will match "South Asia")
- If no countries match the region, it falls back to just filtering by year
- Small countries in pie charts are grouped into "Other" to reduce clutter

### Functional Programming
The code uses Python's functional constructs where it makes sense: `map`, `filter`, `lambda`, list comprehensions. We tried to follow the university's constraint about minimizing loops.

## What Each Graph Shows

1. **Bar Chart** → Top N countries ranked by GDP for the selected year
2. **Pie Chart** → Percentage breakdown of GDP (top 8 countries + "Other")
3. **Histogram** → How GDP values are distributed across countries
4. **Scatter Plot** → GDP values plotted in order

## Error Handling

The app will yell at you if:
- The CSV file doesn't exist
- The JSON config is missing required fields
- The `year` isn't an integer
- The `operation` is neither "average" nor "sum"

Error messages get printed to the terminal. Pretty straightforward.

## Technical Notes

### The Data
World Bank GDP data from 1960-2024. Each country has a region and continent tag, plus GDP values for each year.

### The Weird Stuff
- The CSV has year columns (1960, 1961, etc.), so `data_cleaner.py` unpacks those into individual rows. This is why it looks a bit ugly.
- If the exact region name isn't in the data, the code tries substring matching, then falls back to year-only. This is because region names in different sources vary (e.g., "Asia" vs. "East Asia & Pacific").


## Running a Quick Test

```bash
# Make sure dependencies are installed
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

# Run the default analysis (South Asia, 2020, average)
python SDA_Project/main.py

# Close the graphs as they pop up
```

You should see output like:
```
GDP ANALYTICS DASHBOARD
===================================
Region    : South Asia
Year      : 2020
Operation : AVERAGE
Result    : 1.52 Trillion USD
```

Then four graphs appear.

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "Config file not found"**
- Make sure `SDA_Project/config/config.json` exists
- Check the path is correct

**Error: "GDP CSV file not found"**
- Verify `SDA_Project/data/GDP_Data.csv` is there

**Graphs look weird / x-axis is unreadable**
- This is normal if you have tons of countries. The `top_n` config limits the bar chart. Set it lower if needed.
- Pie chart automatically combines small slices into "Other"

**No data shows up**
- The region might not exist in the dataset. Try a different region like "Asia", "Africa", or "Europe"
- Or check if that year has data for the region you selected

Good luck!
